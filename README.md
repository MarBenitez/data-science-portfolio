# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode, etc.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Supervised Learning: Titanic dataset]([Titanic FE ML Notebook](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/titanic/titanic_FE_ML.ipynb)): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Socialmedia - Exploratory Analysis]([Socialmedia Notebook](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/socialmedia%20EDA/socialmedia_EDA.ipynb)): Exploratory Data Analysis of the social media dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
  		- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis]([Titanic EDA Notebook](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/titanic/titanic_EDA.ipynb)): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualizations.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib_


- ### Micro Projects

	- __Python__
		 -  [ML Using Decision Trees and Random Forests]([Loan Notebook](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/micro%20projects/lending%20loan%20ML/loan_ML_DC_RF.ipynb)): Predicting whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from Kaggle.

		
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn and Matplotlib_
