# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode, etc.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/finding_donors/charityML.ipynb): Exploring a variety of supervised learning techniques to develop a predictive model for determining whether someone earns over $50,000 is crucial for identifying potential contributors to a fictional charity organization.
	- [Supervised Learning: Titanic dataset](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/titanic/titanic_FE_ML.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Socialmedia - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/socialmedia%20EDA/socialmedia_EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis of the social media dataset hosted on Kaggle. Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables.
  		- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/titanic/titanic_EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualizations.
  		- [Data Science salaries Dataset - Data visualization](https://github.com/MarBenitez/visualization-practice/tree/main): Applying data visualization techniques using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
      
	- __Power BI__
		- [Sales Dashboard in Power BI](https://github.com/MarBenitez/sales-dashboard-powerbi): The dashboard provides detailed visualizations of sales across different regions and allows users to explore and analyze the data effectively.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib_


- ### Micro Projects

	- __Python__
		 -  [ML Using Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/MarBenitez/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/micro%20projects/lending%20loan%20ML/loan_ML_DC_RF.ipynb): Predicting whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from Kaggle.
